hello world

I think i'm in love with this girl... she's unlike anything i've ever seen... please, understand that, almost all of the time i'm looking at someone, i can see who they are by their aesthetics, understanding their behaviour next to others, and by doing the same with those others next to the person in question... and by doing that, i can see patterns forming left and right, connecting one people to several others. It's like everyone is the same only with minor changes but their patterns are still al the same, i see people who are really enthusiastic about everything, very social and have lots of friends, this is someone who probably likes to party all the time, get laid a lot and doesn't care about anything because life is about what you make of it and they want to make the best of their lives at every moment. I see people who focus really hard on their work/job, that doesn't have that many friends, that likes to keep themselves for those who are really close to them and don't think that partying all the time is the best way to live your life because you're not really giving much attention to your future, you're only worrying about life now and not life later. Maybe there are even more patterns and maybe those two can be found even in one person alone, it's a really crazy world we live in... but when i look at her... i can't see anything. It's like all of those patterns and standards aren't oart of her. It's strange, and i don't know what to do, i've never felt for anyone what i'm feeling for her, but i'm too shy and afraid to go there and talk to her, i'm too afraid of messing everything up and losing my chances with someone that could be the SHE of my life. I don't know what to do, but you shouldn't, even if you don't know what to do, don't be afraid, go there and talk to her, say something, ANYTHING, just make a connection to her, make your presence noted, don't lose this opportunity, it might just be the only one you'll ever have...
